I am a Master's student, studying Automotive Engineering at RWTH Aachen. I graduated in 2017 with a major and minor degree in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mathematics, from IIT Kanpur. During my career I have worked on the design and dynamics of Automotive vehicles, humanoid Robots, and material handling robots for warehouse.
